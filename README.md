# BNBU-MTMC
BNBU-MTMC is a comprehensive indoor Multi-Target Multi-Camera (MTMC) person re-identification dataset specifically designed for indoor surveillance scenarios.

## Dataset Characteristics

### Environment
- **Location**: T4 building, Beijing Normal University-Hong Kong Baptist University (BNBU) campus
- **Setting**: Diverse indoor environments including lobbies, offices, meeting rooms, pantries, and lounges
- **Cameras**: 10 strategically positioned cameras (C1-C10) with varying heights and angles

Our dataset showcases unique indoor challenges compared to popular outdoor datasets (Market1501, DUKE, CUHK03):
- **(a) Occlusions**: Various obstructions common in indoor environments
- **(b) Lighting Changes**: Diverse illumination conditions across different indoor spaces  
- **(c) Poses**: Wide range of human postures and activities specific to indoor settings
- **(d) Camera Placements**: Variety in camera angles reflecting complex indoor layouts
